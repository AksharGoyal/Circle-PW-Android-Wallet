# Circle PW Android Wallet

I participated in "Getting Started with Programmable Wallets" campaign presented by StackUp in collaboration with Circle to understand more about Programmable Wallets, creating and managing secure web3 wallets and mastering the art of interacting with the suite of Programmable Wallet API suite with developer-friendly REST APIs.

Programmable Wallets also offer compatibility across various blockchain networks like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon and are well-positioned to onboard the masses into Web3!

There were 2 tracks: iOS and Android. As a Windows user, I chose **Android** and got hands-on experience with Android Studio.

Thanks to this campaign, I learnt how to: 
 -  Create your very own user-controlled wallet seamlessly 
 - Get a comprehensive overview of your wallet details and token balances 
 - Facilitate Inbound and outbound token transfers 
 - Effortlessly access your past transactions 
 - Use leading programming language Kotlin for Android development

To use this app, you will need Postman to work with APIs, Circle account for digital wallet creation and transactions, and Android Studio with latest Java installed. You can learn to make this by following [this tutorial](https://app.stackup.dev/campaign_page/circle-programmable-wallets).

Happy coding :keyboard::computer:
